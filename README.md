# qing-materialize

 # Materialize is a CSS framework that follows Google's Material Design guidelines. It provides a set of pre-designed and responsive user interface components and styles for building web applications and websites. 

# For me, I really like the Material Design Aesthetics. Materialize provides clean, intuitive, and visually appealing user interfaces. This design language emphasizes the use of grid layouts, shadow effects, animations, and vibrant colors. It also provides an Extensive Component Library: Materialize provides a wide range of UI components, including buttons, navigation bars, cards, forms, modals, and more. These components come with predefined styles and behaviors, making creating consistent and visually pleasing designs easier. For example, It has a pulse button which is going to be so easy for users to use and recognizable. In addition, it provides Sass Support, JavaScript Features, and Active Community and Resources.
